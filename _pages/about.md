My research interests lie broadly in high-dimensional statistics, generative AI and diffusion models, reinforcement learning from human feedback, astrostatistics, sequential analysis, quantum tomography, random matrix theory, nonconvex optimization.

Here is a current copy of my [CV](https://hongruzhao.github.io/files/CV2025Nov.pdf).


## Recent highlights

My latest preprints cover self-consuming generative models, and stochastic gravitational-wave background detection.
